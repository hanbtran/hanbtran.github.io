I am a first year computer ngineering major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1:
Although simple, Lab 1 is one of my favorites because itâ€™s my first interaction with coding and C++. It was very educational and I enjoyed the simple beginning process. The ending result felt accomplished as well.

Lab 6:
I enjoyed Lab 6 because it is one of my favorite card games. From the code, I learned about the danger of a messy if statement. Additionally, I enjoyed the end result.

Lab 7:
I enjoyed Lab 7 because it felt like a puzzle. From that lab, I learned more about using std::string along with if statements. In the end, the lab all clicked together which was very satisfying.
